1.Development of RAG Pipeline: This is the core system i have  built. It's designed to allow users to interact with PDF files in a conversational manner, even without an internet connection.

2.Integration of Retrieval Component with Mistral Llama Model: 
I combined two different technologies seamlessly. The Mistral Llama model likely handles the generation of responses, while the retrieval component helps find relevant information within the PDF files.
